Bongo Frontend Developer Written Test
I have created the repository as a part of written test for Bongo BD.
Here I only used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Raw PHP
I have used two js lib materialize.min.js and jquery-3.4.0.min.js and ond css lib materializa.min.css

Anyone can check the code setting the project into a PHP based web server or can be test using any online php compiler like phpfiddle.org You just upload the file and run.
